## What I did

Let's say that a regular chess board is an 8 x 8 array. With all the pieces stored into one memory. It's easy to figure out which piece goes where, as it is all given.

No, thats a communist ideal. We love democracy. So instead of giving the board memory, let's give all the pieces memory of their own positions. Now we don't know where the pieces are until we ask them instead. Now, we could just save those positions into a board. But that's also a breach of privacy, we should only ask where they are, and if we could move them.

Long live poor optimizatio- I mean, democracy!
